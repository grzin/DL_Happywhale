# Happywhale - Whale and Dolphin Identification

The proposed project aims to develop and implement automated identification techniques for marine mammals using their natural markings, such as dorsal fins and body patterns, through photo-ID analysis. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project seeks to streamline the process of tracking and monitoring individual animals, contributing to conservation efforts and advancing our understanding of marine ecosystems.
